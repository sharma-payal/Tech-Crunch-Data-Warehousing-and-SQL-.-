# Part 1. Normalization - Deliverable: PDF from document

Answer the questions below in a new document.

To get full credit: For questions relating to normal forms, if the dataset fails to be in any of the normal forms below you should document all the ways in which it so fails. For example, if you think the data is not in 1NF, it does not suffice to say, “the data aren’t in 2NF because you can’t be in 2NF without being in 1NF”. You need to be more specific.

This part will use the file techcrunch.csv. This dataset consists of company funding records reported by TechCrunch, a website that reports on the business of technology, startups, venture capital funding, and Silicon Valley. Each row represents one funding event for a company.

i) What is a good choice for a primary key here? In contrast, give an example of an attribute (or composite) that would not be a valid primary key.

Be careful. You can check that your proposal really satisfies the definition of a primary key by sorting your data by the relevant column(s) in Excel.

a) Does the table satisfy 1NF? Why or why not?

b) Does the table satisfy 2NF? Why or why not?

c) Does the table satisfy 3NF? Why or why not?

d) Sketch a proposed Entity-Relationship diagram that would bring this dataset into 3NF. If you answered “yes” to (4), for example, your ERD would just be the raw data table with no changes. If however your ERD requires multiple tables to be in 3NF, you should draw all relationships between them and indicate their type (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.)
